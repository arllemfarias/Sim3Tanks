# Sim3Tanks: A Benchmark Model Simulator for Process Control and Monitoring
Sim3Tanks is suitable for studying and developing process control, fault detection and diagnosis, and fault-tolerant control strategies for nonlinear multivariable systems. This new release was developed in the MATLAB environment, version 9.11.0 (2021b), and can be used via command-line script <`file.m`>. Future releases will include versions for using the simulator via Simulink block diagram <`file.slx`> and graphical user interface <`file.fig`>.

The original paper that publishes the simulator can be accessed at <http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2874752>.
